      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        My role as a manager at Bhojan Ghar Restaurant has honed my ability to
        multitask, communicate effectively, and handle high-pressure situations.
        Whether it’s ensuring smooth restaurant operations or resolving customer
        concerns, these experiences have reinforced my adaptability and
        leadership skills—qualities that seamlessly translate into my work in
        tech and community leadership.

      <h3>What Drives Me? </h3>
      <p>
        I thrive in structured environments where my detail-oriented mindset and
        planning skills can shine. My passion for problem-solving, technology,
        and leadership pushes me to explore new opportunities where I can bridge
        the gap between cultural preservation and innovation. As I continue my
        journey, I aspire to make meaningful contributions in the field of
        software development while staying true to my cultural roots. Whether
        it’s through building applications, leading community initiatives, or
        mentoring others, I strive to create an impact that extends beyond just
        code. If you’d like to connect, collaborate, or simply share ideas, feel
        free to reach out!
